# Introduction to SOA



#Abstract

Achieving business agility and easing the integration of legacy systems are main goals for software development in various business organizations. Business agility is the ability to change the business process quickly in response to the change in the business environment, such as adding a new service to the organization portfolio. One way to achieve this in a fast, yet cost effective way is to adopt the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach. SOA is an architecture methodology that views the system as set of services. The service is a software component that implements a reasonable amount of work. Each service is loosely coupled to increase its scalability and reusability. So, whenever a business need emerges and requires adding new functionality to the system, the development team in the organization can develop a service that fulfill that need, and rapidly integrates it in the current system without the need to change the overall architecture of the system. The aim of this tutorial is to introduce SOA and its benefits, and provide a brief
overview about the popular implementations of SOA and the concept of Web Services.
